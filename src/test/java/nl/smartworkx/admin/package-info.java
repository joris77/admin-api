/**
 * Automation strategy principals:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Automate as much as possible with cucumber
 * <li>Automate as much as possible in isolation in the domain
 * <li>Create meaningful tests
 * </ul>
 * Way of working:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Start with high level cucumber tests for a walking skeleton
 * <li>Add lower level cucumber test when user requirements describe edge cases
 * <li>Add unit tests when requirements can not be described properly in functional terms
 * </ul>
